# My approach/analysis
When i wanted to start working on this project, I had to analyze how exactly the filter system could work. There were different genres for the most of the available video's the first step was to fetch the entries from the JSON and then, assign a class to each specific genres with their corresponding data. There also was a searchbar where the user could write a specific video name to find their result faster. I immediately thought of using the map() and filter() for that function.

# It must work
I tried my best to make sure that my code was clean and easily understandable by adding lots of comments to all my used functions.

# Iterating to github
After each succesful achievements I would make sure that my working code was being iterated to github.

# Avoid side effects
I made sure to avoid side effects by not changing the value of the global variable but instead the variable of the function itself.



Development 4: Opdracht Werkstuk
Short
Podiumaanhuis.be is a new website that offers full video's of theater pieces. It's created very quickly using Webflow, a very simple website creating platform. Now the organisation wants to recreate the app from scratch, using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

One feature is the option to filter the video entries based on genres and audience. Using the JSON fetch the entries, show them on the page, and recreate the filter like it is presented on podiumaanhuis.be.

Requirements
Write out your approach in the readme.md file. Do a functional analysis of the existing app. Plan your data, functions and the flow of your app.
It must work. This is the most important requirement. Don't worry too much about clean code or functional programming in the beginning. Create the app, and iterate.
Push your iterations to github.
Try to make your code as functional & pure as possible.
Try to avoid side effects as much as possible.
Write tests for at least 2 functions
Show the result on the webpage
